This is a Final Project of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In the module Data Analysis with Python, I acted as a Data Analyst, working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. In order to determine the market price of a house given a set of features, I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
